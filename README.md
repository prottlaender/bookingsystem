# Node Express Bookingsystem

1. Requirements


    - Install **node.js and npm** on your computer. You can read how to install node and npm on your Mac on [Digitaldocblog](https://digitaldocblog.com/singleblog?article=1). Other ways to install node.js can be found on [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
    - Install and setup a **MongoDB** on your computer.  You can read how to install and setup MongoDB on a Linux System on [Digitaldocblog](https://digitaldocblog.com/singleblog?article=4). I use MongoDB Community Edition. You can read how to install MongoDB on various platforms on [MongoDB Documentation pages](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/).
    - **git** should be installed on your computer. A very good tutorial can be found here on [Medium](https://medium.com/@george.seif94/a-full-tutorial-on-how-to-use-github-88466bac7d42).
